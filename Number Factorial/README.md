# Factorial Calculator

This repository contains a JavaScript function that calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. 

The `factorial` function takes a single argument `n`, representing the number for which we want to calculate the factorial. The function returns the factorial of `n`.

To use the factorial calculator, simply call the `factorial` function and pass the desired number as an argument. The calculated factorial will be returned.

Example:
```javascript
console.log(factorial(5));
```
Output:
```
120
```
